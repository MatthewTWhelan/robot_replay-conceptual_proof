# robot_replay-conecptual_proof
A proof of concept for a biophysical hippocampal replay computational model used in a Miro robot.

The model is based largely on two computational models of hippocampal reverse replay by Haga and Fukai (2018) and Pang and Fairhall (2019). Shown here is a conceptual proof that the model produces reverse replays in a simulated robotic navigation task.

To use this model, you need ROS Kinetic, Gazebo, and the Miro Developer Kit installed on your Ubuntu machine. Instructions for installation can be found here: http://labs.consequentialrobotics.com/miro-e/docs/

Full details for the scripts are not given here, but this repo contains two sets of trajectory data (data directory) that can be used to test the model (network_replay_test.py).
